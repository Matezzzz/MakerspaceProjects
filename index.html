# Tree Mosaic *(December 2024)*

As a gift to my family for christmas, I decided to make a mosaic version of a painting my mother liked. I took a photo of the original, undid the projection and manually created a digital twin.
Then I took the result and lasercut the pieces out of 5mm plywood and the pattern out of 3mm plywood, forming a mosaic when put together. As a final step, I painted each piece and the pattern individually with metallic acrylic paint to match the original as well as possible. The steps and the result can be seen below:

# Lindt Chocolate Casting *(December 2024)*

After attending a Lindt workshop organized by VIS ([link](https://vis.ethz.ch/en/events/827/)), I attempted to replicate the process at home. I printed a 3D model of a snowman, used the vacuum former to create a cast for each half, and finally tried casting it out of Lindt couverture chocolate.
As the process for creating the halves was not exact and they did not fit together well, I had to do several tries at casting, but in the end I managed to get a snoman that looked decent:

# Factorio T-shirt & Lego Pixel Art *(November 2024)*

After the Space Age DLC for the Factorio game was released, I was infatuated with the game for a few weeks :D.
In these times, two projects came to life: First one was a shirt with the factorio logo embroided on top of it (done with a machine at the Makerspace), and the second one was a 32x32 pixel art of one of the items in the game made out of lego bricks. The original design and the result of both projects can be seen below:

# Blood on the Clocktower *(May 2024 -> Present)*

Blood on the Clocktower is a social deduction game that I got to know at a GECo event here in Zurich.
Since I had a ton of fun playing the few games, I decided to make the game myself, so I could bring it back to Czechia and play it with my friends there. Luckily, the authors of the game are amazing and the designs for all the tokens are readily available on the [game wiki](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Main_Page).

The main idea of the game is that each player gets a token that defines their role.
Each role has a different ability, and defines which team the player belongs to - either they are evil, and their goal is to help kill everyone, or they are good, and they want to figure out the main evil player. All in all, the game consists of a lot of bluffing, social deduction and puzzle solving, in order to either fool the good team or unravel the evil ones.

The main component of the game is the role tokens (defining the role and team of each player) and reminder tokens (helping the narrator to remember the game state and lead the game well).
I began to make the first version of the game - I designed the tokens in photoshop, created a JSON of all the roles and reminders in the first set (Trouble Brewing), and wrote python scripts for converting JSON to photoshop data, utilities, and creating the final SVG to print.
When I had the designs, I headed to the makerspace and lasercut them out of 5mm plywood. The resulting tokens were then handpainted and varnished, and a felt layer was glued to the back. The result was as follows:


<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/botc_token_v1.jpg" alt="Tokens I" class="img-responsive">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/botc_reminders_v1.jpg" alt="Reminders I" class="img-responsive">
</div>

After the game caught on massively and I received some feedback, I decided to make the other sets (Bad Moon Rising & Sects and Violets) too. I changed the design to not include the role description, as that could be found elsewhere, it made the painting much easier and it allowed me to make the role icon even more prominent.
I added the JSONs for the next two sets, lasercut the modified design for both the role and reminder tokens and got a better felt material for the back. The final tokens look like this:

</div>

There is one more set available - the experimental characters, which can be mixed with the ones from other scripts to create ever more unique games. I will likely make these too as soon as I find the time.






# The Puzzle Frame *(March 2024)*

As a relaxing side activity during the exam period, I bought a large 1000 piece Eurographics puzzle of 'The Great Wave off Kanagawa'. After finishing it, I wanted to hang it somewhere in my apartment.
As I got the introduction for the Shaper CNC machine at the makerspace just a month prior, I decided to improve my woodworking skills and attempt to make such frame.
I bought wood beams at Jumbo, and used the Shaper origin to cut a U-shaped notch into each beam. I then used screws and L-shaped brackets to connect the beams together. Before joining the frame, I inserted a greypaper as the back side, the puzzle itself in the middle, and a mineral glass in front. Finally, I added a hanging mechanism to the back. The final frame can be seen below

# The Pawel Shirt *(February 2024)*

For my fathers birthday, I decided to make him a shirt with a printed design. Since he has been enjoying learning how to fly ultra-light planes, I created a design of the plane he flies, used the cutting plotter at the makerspace to create the pattern, and finally printed on a white shirt.

# Ring of lights *(October 2023 -> March 2024)*




I have a ring of lights on the ceiling in my room! These were used by the previous owner of the now turned student house as backlight for psychological sessions held in what is my apartment today. However, the lights were disabled by the previous owner - so with the permission from the current landlord, I decided to try to fix them.

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/ring_of_lights.jpg" alt="Ring of lights" class="img-responsive">
</div>


By connecting each light to the power grid individually, I figured the problem is in the controlling network, not the lights themselves, so I decided to fix and improve that. My goal was to be able to dim each light in real time by sending commands either from my pc or any other device.

After getting some help from Lukas Pfitscher from the ETH Makerspace about which circuits I would want to use to achieve my goals, I came up with the following design - one arduino will control 5 lights using PWM, it will be able to receive commands via bluetooth. I will use a step down converter to obtain power for the arduino, and RobotDyn AC dimmers will be used to modulate the AC current using the PWM sent by the arduino. Then I will have one control network in the wall, that will be able to signal all the arduinos on the ceiling.

I started by creating a demo circuit that is able to control one light by receiving bluetooth commands from my phone:

    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/lights_demo_close.jpg" alt="Light dimming board" class="img-responsive">
</div>

I have tried designing a container to fit the components (connected by dupont wires) into the lamp, however, this has failed completely, as there was not enough space to fit all the wires and I was unable to close the lamp.
For this reason, I have decided to instead design a PCB to hold all the components. Having no experience with PCB design, I first watched a (tutorial series)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szu8dJoyikA] (really well done, can recommend) on how to use the KiCAD software. Then I designed the PCB to hold the components I had, and ordered it from JLCPCB. The result was as follows:

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/lights_pcb_front.jpg" alt="PCB Front" class="img-responsive">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/lights_pcb_back.jpg" alt="PCB Back" class="img-responsive">
</div>

I did make some design mistakes - I swapped two of the output pins for the step-down converter and made some of the holes too little for the 230V input - but I was able to fix all of these after the PCBs arrived, and after soldering all the components, I was able to dim the light again.
However, despite my initial estimates that the PCB would tightly fit into the lamp, the 230V wires surrounding it made fitting difficult, and since I likely had some contact with the metal casing of the lamp, the circuit failed to work at all. After this failure I had to focus on ETH schoolwork again and I was unable to complete the project.

Since I no longer consider the original scope of the project feasible, I might construct a simplified version in the future - either with simple light switches for each color, or maybe with all the PCBs outside the lamps, and only triplets of lamps of the same color being dimmable at once.


# Lasercutter board games & boxes *(October 2023)*

To get better acquainted with the laser cutters available at the Makerspace, I designed a first project - I would create an improved version of the popular board game *Bananagrams* (a quicker version of scrabble) in the Czech language.

I improved the original design of the pieces with small knobs and holes to make long words stay together better, as moving whole words is quite common in the game, and printed all the pieces on 5mm thick plywood. For storage, I used a design I found on the *boxes.py* website, removed some parts to make it git my use case, and created a custom lid design. The finished game looked like this:

# Face chocolate *(October 2023)*

I decided to create a chocolate in the shape of a friends face as a gift for his birthday. I started by taking his photo but converting it directly didn't look so promising, so I looked into edge detection algorithms and ways to convert images to pencil drawings. In the end, I settled on using photoshop to convert the photo to smoothed edges, and used a python script to interpret is as a heightmap. This gave me the basic shape of the 3D model.

The first idea I had was to take an inverse of the face, add a joke nickname from a summer camp where we used to go together and to 3D print the whole thing. The result looked quite neat (though with a few 3D print hairs), but sadly, the chocolate was rather subpar. It had a tendency to stick to the form, and to take tiny pieces of plastic with it, making it inedible. Also, the text was mirrored:

<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/face_3d_print_mold.jpg" alt="Mold" class="img-responsive">
    <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Matezzzz/MakerspaceProjects/main/images/face_3d_print_chocolate.jpg" alt="Chocolate" class="img-responsive">
</div>

Because of this, I looked into alternative ways to construct the mold, and quickly enough, I found a machine that would be able to do just that - the vacuum former at the makerspace can place a plastic sheet over my 3D print, and suck out all the air, forming a food-grade mould. So this is what I went with - after few struggling attempts with the 3D printers (the nozzle kept getting stuck because I was printing at the lowest resolution), I managed to get a succesful print, and created a mold using the vacuum former. The resulting treat looked and tasted great, particularly when cast out of the finest belgian chocolate :D

# Bin 3D labels *(September 2023)*

As a first project to get me acquinted with 3D printing, I decided to create 3D labels for the bins in my apartment. For each label, I created a black PLA frame with extruding text and a complementary PETG part that perfectly fit into the frame and served as a background for the text. The end result looks like this:
